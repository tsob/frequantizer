#frequantizer / supercollider

This folder contains some example SuperCollider code to use our new function,
PV_Quantize, to perform uniform frequency-domain quantization. The subfolders
of this directory contain the necessary files which are added/changed in the
SuperCollider source code which create and enable PV_Quantize. At this time,
you have to change these files on your local SuperCollider copy and then
recompile. In the future, it will either be wrapped into an sc3-plugin or, if
deemed appropriate, pulled into the main SC distribution.
